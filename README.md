## Virtual Machine Installation
1 ‚ó¶ Open Oracle VirtualBox
<img width="836" alt="Screenshot from 2024-07-16 16-53-38" src="https://i.imgur.com/5R3uOrL.png">

2 ‚ó¶ Click on the New command on the top 
![New VM](https://github.com/Vikingu-del/Born2beRoot/raw/main/photos/installation/newVm.png)

3 ‚ó¶ We must choose a name for the machine and the folder which will locate it. IMPORTANT Store the machine created inside the sgoinfre folder located in your campus server; this is important because we will run out of memory space in our session and the installation will fail. (Ask your staff if you can't find it)
