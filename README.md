##  4. Virtual Machine Installation

  

  

1 ‚ó¶ Open Oracle VirtualBox

  

  

2 ‚ó¶ Click on the New command on the top

  

  

<img  width  ="836"  src="<img width="836"  alt="Screenshot from 2024-07-16 16-53-38"  src="https://github.com/Vikingu-del/Born2beRoot/raw/main/photos/installation/newVm.png">">

  

  

3 ‚ó¶ We must choose a name for the machine and the folder which will locate it. IMPORTANT Store the machine created inside the sgoinfre folder located in your campus server; this is important because we will run out of memory space in our session and the installation will fail. (Ask your staff if you can't find it)

  

<img  width="836"  alt="Screenshot from 2024-07-16 16-50-55"  src="https://imgur.com/CCfeFs7.png">

  

  

  

4 ‚ó¶ Now we have to set up the memory size we want to use for our VM. You are free to choose How much memory you want to use from your computer but I would suggest that 1024MB is enough for this project.

  

<img  width="836"  alt="Screenshot from 2024-07-16 16-51-34"  src="https://imgur.com/qf8XQhX.png">

  

  

  

5 ‚ó¶ Now the next prompts are asking to set up a virtual Hard disk. In the VirtualBox setup process, ensure to select 'Dynamically allocated' for storage on the physical hard disk. This option allows the virtual hard disk file to grow in size as needed, optimizing disk space usage. Avoid checking the option to pre-allocate the full size, as it may lead to unnecessary disk space allocation. One we established the recommended `12 GB` we must click on `Create`. If we are doing the bonus we might set `30 GB`.

  

<img  width="836"  alt="Screenshot from 2024-07-16 16-51-44"  src="https://imgur.com/M3WvvRH.png">

<img  width="836"  src="https://github.com/Vikingu-del/Born2beRoot/raw/main/photos/installation/Keyboard.png">

  

  

8 ‚ó¶ First, we need to set the `Hostname`, which should be your login followed by '42', as required by the subject

  

Then, press the Tab key and select Continue.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/lVj1CF0.png">

  

  

9 ‚ó¶ For the `Domain Name`, leave this section empty, as the subject does not specify anything.

  

Then, press the Tab key and select Continue

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/pl6Z0bq.png">

  

  

10 ‚ó¶ We need to set a password for the root user. It is important to write it down or take a photo, as we will need it later. To verify the password, press the `Down Arrow ‚¨áÔ∏è` to the option Show Password in Clear option and press the `Space Bar` to display it. You should see something like the photo below. Then, press the Tab key and select Continue

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/GeH6nHo.png">

  

  

11 ‚ó¶ Repeat the process as you need to confirm the password we just set.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/Q7wARyG.png">

  

  

12 ‚ó¶ Set up the username as specified in the subject, we require a new user that is not the root user, and the username must be your student login.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/k77lb6S.png">

  

  

13 ‚ó¶ Repeat you `User Name`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/z5jZ6Q4.png">

  

  

14 ‚ó¶ Now we need to set the password for our new user. I'm choosing the same password as for the `Root User`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/xDkMipw.png">

  

  

15 ‚ó¶ We confirm the password, to see the password use the `Down Arrow ‚¨áÔ∏è` to reveal the password and press the `Space Bar` Than press Continue with the `Tab Bar`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/3ksvHxJ.png">

  

  

16 ‚ó¶ Select Guied - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùóÔ∏è If you want to do the bonus select Manual and then click here ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66915274/178795367-b82018de-edc8-47d3-8cd6-b90c5e3be2fa.png">

  

  

17 ‚ó¶ Select the disk where you want to create the partition (only one disk should be displayed).

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66915274/178796481-29ef7ebc-0518-40f0-9429-3f43316b35d3.png">

  

  

18 ‚ó¶ After choosing the disk, proceed to create the partition as described in the subject. To do this correctly, select the second option `Separate /home partition`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/cwY7P0j.png">

  

  

19 ‚ó¶ We choose option `Yes` so the changes will be writen in the disk and so we can set the logical volume manager (LVM).

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66915274/178797258-8c34bc31-16a7-4aef-8406-cecc21fdf028.png">

  

  

19 ‚ó¶ We click on `Cancel` the erasing of the data is not required.

20 ‚ó¶ Once again, select a password for encrypting the `LVM`. As mentioned earlier, you'll need to repeat this process, so it's advisable to write it down. You can use the same password as before.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/DSWYNrL.png">

  

  

21 ‚ó¶ Repeat the password we just set.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/VXGHUeh.png">

  

  

22 ‚ó¶In this step, we must input the required amount of volume group to use during the guided partitioning. We can enter `max` or the total available memory, which in this case is `12.4 GB`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66915274/178799165-c6b05fd2-86ad-45b7-a026-9ee169eda5d5.png">

  

  

23 ‚ó¶ To wrap the partitioning and write the changes in the disk we choose the option `Finish partitioning and write changes to disk`.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/ThEB4H7.png">

  

  

24 ‚ó¶ We choose the option `Yes` and then we confirm that we do not want more changes.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/ho1HF2V.png">

  

  

25 ‚ó¶ We select the option `No` since additional packages are not required and we don't need them.

  

<img  width="836"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66915274/178801099-2dda24f5-0d46-4184-8c44-a8fe0bf46527.png">

##  6. Virtual Machine Setupüì°

  

‚û§ First of all, we must select `Debian GNU/Linux`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/gjPh3EF.png">

  

‚û§ Now, we must enter the encryption password that we previously set. In my case, it is `ldurmish42`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/ZoPXpI7.png">

  

‚û§ After that we must introduce the user and password that we created.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/dbvFPQg.png">

  

‚û§In my case the user is `ldurmish` and the password is `ldurmish42`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/Xp3M5o3.png">

### We have set everything ready for starting the setup of our Debian virtual machine‚ùóÔ∏è

  

##  6.1 Installing Sudo and Configuring Users and Groupsüë§

1 ‚ó¶ The installation begins by switching the user to root so we can install `sudo`. To do this, enter `su` at the bash prompt and provide the root password, which is `ldurmish42` in my case. Once logged in as root, run the command `apt install sudo` to have the package manager install the required packages for `sudo`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/86gUU8q.png">

  

2 ‚ó¶ We must reboot machine so the changes can be applied. For that purpose we will use the command `sudo reboot`

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/PFs6oEr.png">

  

3 ‚ó¶ Once the machine is rebooted we have to input the encryption password and the login again. To check if sudo have been installed correctly we must switch to root user and then use the command `sudo -V`; this command will show the sudo version (it will show extra info like the plugins installed).

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/cFc0sCu.png">

**OPTIONAL** ‚û§ In case of the output being too large we can redirect the command output to a file via `sudo -V > file.txt` . The `> file.txt` part of the command saves the output into a file named `file.txt`, replacing any existing content in that file.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/gICBKU5.png">

Then edit the file using `nano file.txt` ,`vim` or `cat`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/T6QohNe.png">

Exit from `nano file.txt` using `Ctrl X`

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/qTSA49M.png">

Other option would be putting `sudo -V| more` after the command.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/DT7ycDo.png">

  

4 ‚ó¶ **Now, this step is for the everyone that didn't put his user as the other user asked by the subject during the installation of the system.** Still in the root user we will create an additional user with `sudo adduser <login>`. If you had already done it will show the same message as is the image.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/S4LsIGa.png">

  

5 ‚ó¶ We will create a new group called `user42`. For that we must use `sudo addgroup user42`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/GMR4re8.png">

  

6 ‚ó¶ With `sudo adduser <user> <groupname>` we can include a user to a group. We must include out user in the groups `sudo` and `user42`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/hKTkHQj.png">

  

7 ‚ó¶ Or editing the /etc/group file using `nano /etc/group` the groups `sudo` and `user42` must be present with our user.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/sRq3jFC.png">

ü§î **Was the group created without problems?** Truth is that there is no sign of one, still we can check it using `getent group <groupname>` or we can also use `cat /etc/group` and see all groups and the users in any of them.

8 ‚ó¶ Once we are done with that we can check it using `getent group <groupname>` the groups `sudo` and `user42` must be present with our user.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/Wis6XA2.png">

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/4gQ943a.png">

  

##  6.2 Installing and Configuring SSHüì∂

##  üß† What is SSH‚ùì

  

SSH stands for "Secure Shell." It is a protocol designed to provide a secure way to access a remote computer. Unlike older methods that weren't secure, SSH encrypts the connection between your computer and the remote computer, making it safe from eavesdropping and hacking.

  

###  How Does SSH Work?

  

SSH works using a client-server model, where:

  

-  **Client:** This is your computer.

-  **Server:** This is the remote computer you want to connect to.

  

When you use SSH to connect to the server, a secure channel is created between the client and the server, allowing you to send commands and receive data safely.

1 ‚ó¶ First thing, we write the command `su` to switch in the root and we should update the system using `sudo apt update`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/T3jZ3el.png">

  

2 ‚ó¶ Following up we will install the main tool for remote access with the SSH protocol, using Open SSH. The installation requires the package `sudo apt install openssh-server`.

When we are asked for confirmation we will write `y`, and just then the installation will proceed.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/iPIWYjM.png">

  

Curious to see if the installation has been completed without problems?

You can use `sudo service ssh status` to check the status. It should show **Active** to confirm that it is running correctly.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/4L4Aey3.png">

  

3 ‚ó¶ Going on, some files have been created and we need to configure them. For that we will use [Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Nano) or [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) (we will need to install vim since it's not preinstalled using `sudo apt install vim`) or any other text editor.

Press y to confirm the installation.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/gGaFmAb.png">

  

4 ‚ó¶ First file that we will edit will be `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. If you are not on root you will not be able to edit the file, as you know, for switching to root we use `su`.

<img  width="836"  src="https://imgur.com/7uyBoXP.png">
